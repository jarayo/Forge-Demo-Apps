# Facebook login

This app should be all you need to get going with the facebook module on Forge.

To get started you will need to create an app with Facebook (https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and put your app id into src/config.json.

Once you do that, see http://docs.trigger.io/en/v1.4/modules/facebook.html for information about how to configure your Facebook app to work on mobile devices.

This app demonstrates some simple Facebook API usage, such as authentication and sending / receiving data from Facebook.
