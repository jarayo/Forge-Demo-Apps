# Facebook login

This app should be all you need to get going with the facebook module on Forge. To get started you will need to create an app with Facebook (https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and put your app id into src/config.json. Once you do that you should be able to build the app using Forge and try out some simple Facebook API examples. For further details see http://docs.trigger.io/en/v1.4/modules/facebook.html.
